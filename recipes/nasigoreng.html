    <p>Nasi goreng, or also fried rice, is a dish that can combine multiple ingredients in one pan. 
        You can mix it with meat, vegetables, eggs, tofus, and so on. Nasi goreng can be nutritious and easy to make.
        This recipe only contains the steps to create essential nasi goreng. You can adjust the ingredients as you prefer.
        Follow the instructions below to create your own nasi goreng!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of cooked rice</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. of cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. of soy sauce <em>or</em> a pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Chopped scallions, for garnishing</li>
        <li>(Optional) 1 Tbsp. of sweet soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It would be better if you used a day old rice that's stored in a fridge, so that the rice would't be too mushy.
        You can use soy sauce to make the rice looks brown, or if you prefer yellow then just use salt and let the eggs do the work.
        If you prefer sweet and salty sauce, you can use both soy sauces.
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in the pan, and add the garlic, fry until it turns golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the beaten eggs to the pan and cook until it's half-cooked.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked rice and mix the ingredients together, add soy sauces/salt and mix it again.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and add scallions.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Tips: If you want that grilled look on meat/fish, you can cook the meat/fish first in the oil first and place it on a plate. You can add the meat/fish last after cooking the fried rice.</p>
